# particles
These are actually two implementations of a particle simulator, one is using a delta t and the other is using a delta t of 1.

# To Use
These programs require you to link the ncurses library with them to run, but other than that they don't need anything special.
Make sure your terminal window is full screen. The start-screen.txt can be edited to whatever you want! 

Enjoy!
